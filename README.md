System:
* Intel Xeon 2.2 GHz processor using 32 cores and 1TB of RAM. 
* Assembly evaluation was performed using LASER (Khiste and Ilie, 2015).





SOAPdenovo2 was the fastest (<1 day), SGA the slowest (5–19 days); SAGE2 came second (<2 days) followed closely by ABySS (>2 days). About memory, SGA used the least (<100GB) while the other three assemblers were comparable. It is worth noticing that SAGE2 scaled the best with read length; this was the most obvious for the GIAB dataset where SAGE2 used under 300GB, ABySS used almost 900GB and SOAPdenovo2 ran out of space with 1TB
